<h1>Essential photography tips</h1>
<ul>

<h2><li>Learn to hold your camera properly</li></h2>

<img class=img1 src ="camera.jpeg">

<p>This may sound obvious, but many new photographers don’t hold their camera correctly, which causes 
camera shake and blurry images. Tripods are of course the best way to prevent camera shake,but when 
holding your camera it’s important to hold properly to avoid unnecessary movement.<br><br>
While you’ll eventually develop your own way of holding the camera, you should always hold it with both
 hands. Grip the right side of the camera with your right hand and place your left hand beneath the 
 lens to support the weight of the camera.
<br><br>

The closer you keep the camera to your body, the stiller you’ll be able to hold it. If you need extra
 stability you can lean up against a wall or crouch down on your knees, but if there’s nothing to lean
 on, adopting a wider stance can also help.
 <h2><li>Understanding exposure triangle</li></h2>
 
 <img class=img1 src ="iso.jpeg">
 
 <p>Although it can seem a bit daunting at first, the exposure triangle simply refers to the three most
 important elements of exposure; ISO, aperture and shutter speed. When you’re shooting in manual mode, 
 you’ll need to be able to balance all three of these things in order to get sharp, well-lit photos. 
 <br><br>
 ISO: ISO controls the camera’s sensitivity to light. A low ISO setting means the camera will be less 
 sensitive to light, while a higher ISO means it will be more sensitive to light.
 <br><br>
 Aperture: Aperture is the opening in your lens and controls how much light gets through to the 
 camera’s sensor. A wider aperture (indicated by a lower f-number) lets more light through, while a 
 narrow aperture (indicated by a higher f-number) lets less light through. A wide aperture is great 
 when you want to isolate your subject, but when you want the whole scene to be in focus, such as with 
 group shots, you’ll need to use a narrow aperture.
<br><br>
Shutter speed: Shutter speed controls how long the shutter stays open when you take a picture. The 
longer the shutter stays open, the more light gets through to the camera’s sensor. A fast shutter speed
 is good for freezing action, while a longer shutter speed will blur motion.</p>
 


 <h2><li> Play with Perspective</li></h2>
  <img class=img1 src ="perspective.jpg">

 <br><br>
 
The best way to get a bit more creative with your photography is to experiment with perspective. 
The exact same scene can often look very different when approached from a different angle, and
 capturing your subject from above or below may change the whole feel of a photograph. 
<br><br>
<p>Not every angle will work for every photograph, of course, but you’ll never know what works and what 
doesn’t if you don’t experiment. When shooting animals or children, you can try getting down to their 
level and viewing the world through their eyes. If you’re shooting a portrait, why not stand on a bench
and shoot your subject from above? </p>

<h1>Food Photography 101</h1>
<div class=i2>
<img src ="food2.jfif">
</div>

<ol>
<h2><li>Prepare your food to be photo-ready: </li></h2>
<p>Arrange your food to show-off its best features. Choose complementary surfaces and cutlery. Plate 
the main subject of your photo in the middle of your plate and leave room on the edges. </p>
<h2><li>Get the lighting right:</li></h2>
 <p>Light from the side, rather than the front. Use natural light whenever possible, softer light when 
 not.Watch for harsh shadows. </p>
<h2><li>Experiment with framing:</li> </h2>
<p>Try photographing from different angles. Use warmer, more appetizing colors that are true-to-life.
 Use depth-of-field to focus on the most appetizing aspects of your photo.</p>
<h2><li>Edit your food photos like a professional:</h2></li>
 <p>Sharpen your image. Adjust the white balance to negate cooler colors and bring out warm ones. Increase
 contrast, brightness, and saturation, but only slightly. </p>
<h2><li>Don’t be afraid to get creative: </h2></li>
<p>Rules are made to be broken. A unique angle, perspective, color palette, or composition can help make 
your food photos stand-out.</p>

<h1>LIGHTING TECHNIQUES</h1>
<ul>
<div class=i2>

</div>
<h2><li>Practise evaluating your enviourment</li></h2>


<p>All lights are not created equal. They all have unique attributes like brightness, softness and temperature. Different 
light sources can work together–or they can work against each other.
<br><br>
Natural daylight is generally considered the best light source because it has a broad spectrum. Rooms with large windows can
 be a great asset, but on the other hand, if a beam of direct sunlight falls directly on your subject then you may need to 
 try to find another spot in the room to shoot. The goal in this scenario is to have the sunlight to bounce and fill the 
 room without directly landing on your subject.
<br><br>
Wherever you are, the first step to becoming a master at lighting is to look around you and see what you have to work with.</p>

<h2><li>Start with the key light</li></h2>
<div class=i2>
<img src ="light.jfif">
</div>
<p>If you’re shooting outside, the key light source will typically be the sun. It’s challenging and unadvisable to try to 
overpower the sun with light sources. One exception is during “golden hour,” the moments during sunset when the sun is at 
its furthest angle. During this time, the sun is less intense and casts a beautiful warm hue on subjects.
<br><br>
If it’s a cloudy day, you’re in luck for your portrait session because the sun is already diffused. You won’t get a big blue
 sky in the background but it’s always more important that your subject is lit well. Another approach in broad daylight is 
 to take cover in the shade and if possible, add some light to your subjects’ faces. The drawback to shooting in the shade 
 is that if your background is in broad daylight, it is easy to get blown out.</p>
 
 <h2><li>Use shadows to create contrast in your images</li></h2>
 <div class=i2>
  <img src ="shadow.jpg">
 </div>
 <p>In general, the more light the better.
<br><br>
However, contrast is how photographers impart depth and interest into their images. You can’t have an image with beautiful 
contrast unless the image includes sections that are brighter and parts that are darker.
<br><br>
Take a moment while you’re composing your image to think about what you want to be dark in your photos, in addition to what 
you want to be illuminated. Visualize it and then position your subjects or your lights to create contrast. In time, this 
will become second nature.
<br><br>
Indoors, controlling the light typically means you need to be able to light the scene with your own light, which gives you 
far more control. That will be your “key” light. At the same time, think about turning off any lights that detract from your
scene. Modern DSLR’s can perform very well in low light, but they can’t prevent the color casts created by mixed lighting.<p>
